# Quick Start

EMQ X Edge connects to Storm platform through  [emqx-storm](http://github.com/emqx/emqx-storm)  plug-in and communicates management instructions. The steps of enabling preparation and operation are as follows:

1. The emqx-edge version is greater than or equal to v3.1-rc.3 [click to download](https://www.emqx.io/downloads/emq/edge?OsType=Raspberry%20Pi#download)

2. Edge's network environment can establish communication links with [storm.emqx.io:1883](storm.emqx.io:1883)

3. Register [EMQ account](https://www.emqx.io/account?Tab=register) and create a new edge message server in [Storm](https://storm.emqx.io)

4. Fill in the configuration in Storm on Edge and start the emqx-storm plug-in

> Note: It will not affect the normal use of other Edge features without the connection of storm.

Open the Edge emqx-storm plug-in configuration file `etc/plugins/emqx_storm.conf`, with the following modifications:

```bash
# Storm connection adressï¼Œdefault storm.emqx.io:1883
storm.address = storm.emqx.io:1883

# Authentication username, Username information in the usage details
storm.username = 40e02ab0-5b68-11e9-ac3b-b1515a08538d

# Authentication password, password information in the usage details
storm.password = b67aa008-c7f8-4b70-b06c-5cdba92f3ff7
```



## Start and connect



If the configuration is correct, Edge will automatically establish a connection with Storm after successful start-up. At this time, the state of the relevant server in Storm will be set to **online**. Click on the relevant Tab page to get the corresponding operation indicators.
